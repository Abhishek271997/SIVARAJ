# SIVRAJ
A Basic Prototype for SIVRAJ

1Ô∏è‚É£ main.py (FastAPI Backend)
This is the main API server that receives job posting links and runs validation checks.

from fastapi import FastAPI
from job_validation import validate_job

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Welcome to Job Validator AI"}

@app.post("/validate_job/")
def validate_job_posting(job_url: str):
    result = validate_job(job_url)
    return {"job_url": job_url, "validation_result": result}
2Ô∏è‚É£ job_validation.py (Basic Job Validation Logic)
This is the job scanning logic (we will improve it later with AI & APIs).


import re

def validate_job(job_url):
    
    Dummy function to check job posting validity.
    Later, we will use web scraping, API calls & AI models.
    
    fake_job_patterns = ["earn quick money", "no experience needed", "work from home $$$"]
    
    # Dummy logic: If URL contains "linkedin.com", assume it's valid
    if "linkedin.com" in job_url:
        return "Legitimate Job Posting ‚úÖ"
    
    # Simulated check against scam keywords
    for pattern in fake_job_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, job_url, re.IGNORECASE):
            return "Warning: This job post may be a scam! ‚ö†Ô∏è"

    return "Not Enough Data to Validate ‚ùì"
