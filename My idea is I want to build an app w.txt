My idea is I want to build an app without any coding knowledge and I have lot doubts and about starting with step I want to thank you for helping me sivraj

SIVRAJ my idea is to create an application or website for students and job seekers 
Nowadays, job postings are like mini scams; they are not 100% real, so I want to start an app that can validate the jobs posted in multiple applications.

Here is the ideas - 
IDEA:1
Once the user sees the job advertisement, the user can copy the link of the job posting and paste it into our site then we will validate the job application genuity by comparing the company website( company mail ID) and the job posted recruiters mail ID 
with that, we can match the ingenuity of the job postings.

IDEA:2
Once the user completes the validation in Step 1, the next step will be the Job match with the profile where the user can paste the Job posted link by recruiter.
User task: 
Task 1:
The user needs to upload the job posted job link to our site ( eg: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/collections/recommended/?currentJobId=4132259253)
Task 2:
The user has to upload the CV to validate the job description.

The role of the tool:
The tool needs to match the profiles with the job descriptions to get matching scores and give the outputs, which the user can modify the CV as per the ATS standards and job description.

moreover, we need to provide the CV templates and Cover letter templates with auto-generated with the information provided by the users.
